            <h3>A little about me</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Hi My name is Đorđe Timotijević and I was born on the 20th of February 1997 in Kragujevac, central Serbia.</p>
                <p>I spent my childhood on the streets of our little planned neighborhood playing with the local kids, reenacting scenes from cartoons and movies, of which The Lord of the Rings was my favorite and still is to this day. At that age I also began to develope and intrest in history and video games, particulary the ones set during the medieval times.</p>
                <p>After primary school, I went to our local technical high school, which proved to be a disappointing experience due to my lack of discipline and the general atmosphere of the school. At that time, I began to learn digital marketing to help my father with his online shop. At this time, I also developed an interest in economics and politics.</p>
                <p>The college I attended was also focused on IT, but I soon dropped out due to marketing taking up most of my time. Eventually I decided to return to programming, and here I am, doing this course.</p>
                <p>I like to spend my free time doing some of my hobbies, of which my favorites are reading <a href="/books_movies.html">(here are some of my favorite books)</a> and <a href="/games.html"> video games.</a></p>
