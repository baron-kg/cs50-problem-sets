Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The great jump when doing 100K simulations to 1M simulations was very unexpected.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Given the mentioned time jump in the previous answer, a 100K simulations looks acceptable.
