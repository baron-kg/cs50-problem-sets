sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Testing sort1 with 50K sorted numbers gives the lowest running time, and since sort2 uses merge sort and sort3 takes a lot longer to run, bubble sort seems the most likely.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: The running time on sort2 when tested with 50K random numbers is significantly better than when tested with the other sorts.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: By elimination.
